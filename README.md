# SpringBoot-Membership
This project is a springboot API that takes in data and return a membership list. 
It consists of one entity class, a rest controller class and a service class. 
There is also testing for the service and controller classes.
It can be used with h2 console, and SQL to generate databases. 
It can be tested with Postman to generate instances of the entity.

Getting Started
These insturctions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project ona  live system. 

Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Install Maven
Install Springboot
Install Lombok 
Install Swagger UI so when the application is run, API documentation will be automatically generated and available at /swagger-ui/

Why are we doing this?
To create a Spring Boot API with full CRUD functionality.

How I expected the challenge to go?
I expected the challenge to go exactly as it did, fairly difficult and leaving me with more programming knowledge than what I previously had.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
The API CRUD functionality was successfully implemented.
Unfortunately I had to get rid of my own custom queries and DTO as the deadline got closer.

Possible improvement for future revisions of the project.
Custom Queries
Use of DTO
Custom Exceptions
